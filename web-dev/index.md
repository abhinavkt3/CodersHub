> Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex Web-based Internet applications (Web apps), electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development. Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.


## Overview of Web Development

Web development has been a growing industry since the commercialization of the web. It encompasses a wide range of topics and skills, including but not limited to creating and maintaining web applications, creating and maintaining websites, and creating and maintaining web services. Web development includes many types of web content creation. Some examples include hand coding web pages in a text editor, building a website in a program like Dreamweaver, and updating a blog via a blogging website. In recent years, content management systems like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla have also become popular means of web development. These tools make it easy for anyone to create and edit their own website using a web-based interface.

## Introduction to Web Development

Web Development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a web site for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). If you want to share your thoughts, ideas, and information with the world, you need a website. And if you want to create a website, you need to learn web development. Web development is the process of building and maintaining a website. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. While the terms **web developer** and **web designer** are often used synonymously, they do not mean the same thing. Technically, a web designer only designs website interfaces using HTML and CSS. A web developer may be involved in designing a website, but may also write web scripts in languages such as PHP and ASP. Additionally, a web developer may help maintain and update a database used by a dynamic website.

## Web Development Tools

Web development tools have come a long way in just a few short years. Thanks to the rapid advancement of technology, web development tools are no longer limited to text editors. Today, we have a wide range of tools available to help streamline the web development process. These tools are designed to help developers create, debug, and maintain websites and applications. They also help to ensure that the final product is both functional and visually appealing. Some of the most popular web development tools include:

They include everything from simple HTML and CSS to more advanced technologies like PHP, JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails. Web development technologies are constantly evolving, and new technologies are being developed all the time. 

**We are categorizing the technologies used in web development into two main categories:**

- **Front-End Technologies:** These are the technologies that are used to create the user interface of a website or web application. They include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js.

- **Back-End Technologies:** These are the technologies that are used to create the server-side of a website or web application. They include programming languages like PHP, Python, and Ruby, as well as frameworks and libraries like Node.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails.

### Front-End Technologies
